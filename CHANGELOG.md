# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial open-source release extracted from a private research-platform IaC repo.
- `modules/bootstrap` — Terraform state backend (S3 + DynamoDB lock table) and
  GitHub OIDC CI/preview roles with state writes scoped to `preview/*`.
- `modules/network` — multi-AZ VPC with an optional Tailscale subnet router.
- `modules/eks-platform` — EKS cluster plus toggleable cluster-wide operators
  (Karpenter, AWS Load Balancer Controller, metrics-server, kube-prometheus,
  Fluent Bit, Kubecost, GPU/Neuron device plugins, KubeRay, Argo, Tailscale).
- `modules/workloads` — name-prefixable application layer (webapp, JupyterHub,
  Dagster, MLflow, Ray) with per-service `enable_*` toggles, powering preview
  environments that stamp prefixed copies onto a shared cluster.
- `modules/s3-bucket` — hardened S3 bucket with KMS, lifecycle, and IAM policies.
- `modules/preview-storage` — ephemeral per-preview processed-data bucket.
- `modules/neon-branches` — copy-on-write Neon Postgres branches for previews.
- `examples/{minimal,complete,preview}` — runnable reference stacks.
- Reusable `preview-up`, `preview-down`, and `nightly-sweep` GitHub workflows
  (`workflow_call`).
- Plan-only `tofu test` toggle-matrix suites for `bootstrap`, `network`, and
  `workloads` (mocked providers; assert each `enable_x = false` creates no
  resources of that family).
- terraform-docs-generated tables in every module README, plus a root README and
  `docs/preview-environments.md` design writeup.

### Changed vs. the original private repo

- Provider blocks hoisted out of the `s3-bucket` and `network` modules
  (registry compatibility; enables `count`/`for_each`).
- JupyterHub moved from the cluster module into `workloads` so it can be
  toggled per environment and previewed.
- Dagster's implicit dependency on Ray is now an explicit precondition.
- Private ingress class is configurable (Tailscale remains the documented default).
- Helm chart tarballs un-vendored in favour of pinned upstream repositories.
- Preview GPU NodePools are name-prefixed; preview MLflow artifacts route to the
  ephemeral bucket.
- EKS module bumped from v20 to v21 so the whole family standardizes on the AWS
  v6 provider (the v20 module capped `aws < 6.0`, which conflicted with the
  VPC v6 module and blocked composing the modules in one configuration).
- Helm provider 3 + `eks-blueprints-addons` 1.24.3 (the private repo is stuck on
  helm 2 / blueprints 1.23 because the provider-2→3 state migration is broken
  upstream; a green-field OSS apply never migrates state, so it adopts helm 3
  cleanly — and shipping the `~> 2.17` cap would otherwise force every consumer
  onto helm 2). No divorce from `eks-blueprints-addons` is needed: 1.24.3
  supports helm 3.
- Fixed the `network` secondary (pod) CIDR split, which was hardcoded to two
  AZs (`cidrsubnet(secondary, 1, k)`) yet defaulted to three; newbits now scale
  with the AZ count.
